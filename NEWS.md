# glmnet 3.0

 This is a major revision with much added functionality, listed
 roughly in order of importance. An additional vignette called `relax`
 is supplied to describe the usage.
 
* `relax` argument added to `glmnet`. This causes the
   models in the path to be refit without regularization. The
   resulting object inherits from class `glmnet`, and has an
   additional component, itself a glmnet object, which is the relaxed
   fit.
* `relax` argument to `cv.glmnet`. This allows selection from a
   mixture of the relaxed fit and the regular fit. The mixture is
   governed by an argument `gamma` with a default of 5 values between
   0 and 1.  
* `predict`, `coef` and `plot` methods for `relaxed` and `cv.relaxed`
   objects.
* `print` method for `relaxed` object, and new `print` methods for
   `cv.glmnet` and `cv.relaxed` objects.
* A progress bar is provided via an additional argument
   `trace.it=TRUE` to `glmnet` and `cv.glmnet`. This can also be set
   for the session via `glmnet.control`.   
* Three new functions `assess.glmnet`, `roc.glmnet` and
   `confusion.glmnet` for displaying the performance of models.
* `makeX` for building the `x` matrix for input to `glmnet`. Main
   functionality is *one-hot-encoding* of factor variables, treatment
   of `NA` and creating sparse inputs.
* `bigGlm` for fitting the GLMs of `glmnet` unpenalized.

In addition to these new features, some of the code in `glmnet` has
been tidied up, especially related to CV.
   
# glmnet 2.0-20

* Fixed a bug in internal function `coxnet.deviance` to do with input
  `pred`, as well as saturated `loglike` (missing) and weights
* added a `coxgrad` function for computing the gradient

# glmnet 2.0-19

* Fixed a bug in coxnet to do with ties between death set and risk set

# glmnet 2.0-18

* Added an option alignment to `cv.glmnet`, for cases when wierd
  things happen

# glmnet 2.0-17

* Further fixes to mortran to get clean fortran; current mortran src is in
  `inst/mortran`

# glmnet 2.0-16

* Additional fixes to mortran; current mortran src is in
  `inst/mortran`
* Mortran uses double precision, and variables are initialized to
  avoid `-Wall` warnings
* cleaned up repeat code in CV by creating a utility function

# glmnet 2.0-15

* Fixed up the mortran so that generic fortran compiler can
  run without any configure

# glmnet 2.0-13

* Cleaned up some bugs to do with exact prediction
* `newoffset` created problems all over - fixed these

# glmnet 2.0-11

* Added protection with `exact=TRUE` calls to `coef` and
  `predict`. See help file for more details

# glmnet 2.0-10

* Two iterations to fix to fix native fortran registration.

# glmnet 2.0-8

* included native registration of fortran

# glmnet 2.0-7

* constant `y` blows up `elnet`; error trap included
* fixed `lambda.interp` which was returning `NaN` under degenerate
  circumstances.

# glmnet 2.0-6

* added some code to extract time and status gracefully from a `Surv` object

# glmnet 2.0-3

* changed the usage of `predict` and `coef` with `exact=TRUE`. The
  user is strongly encouraged to supply the original `x` and `y`
  values, as well as any other data such as weights that were used in
  the original fit.

# glmnet 2.0-1

* Major upgrade to CV; let each model use its own lambdas, then predict at original set.
* fixed some minor bugs

# glmnet 1.9-9

* fixed subsetting bug in `lognet` when some weights are zero and `x` is sparse

# glmnet 1.9-8

* fixed bug in multivariate response model (uninitialized variable), leading to valgrind issues
* fixed issue with multinomial response matrix and zeros
* Added a link to a glmnet vignette


# glmnet 1.9-6

* fixed bug in `predict.glmnet`, `predict.multnet` and `predict.coxnet`,
  when `s=` argument is used with a vector of values. It was not doing
  the matrix multiply correctly
* changed documentation of glmnet to explain logistic response matrix

# glmnet 1.9-5

* added parallel capabilities, and fixed some minor bugs

# glmnet 1.9-3

* added `intercept` option

# glmnet 1.9-1

* added upper and lower bounds for coefficients
* added `glmnet.control` for setting systems parameters
* fixed serious bug in `coxnet`

# glmnet 1.8-5

* added `exact=TRUE` option for prediction and coef functions

# glmnet 1.8

* Major new release
* added `mgaussian` family for multivariate response
* added `grouped` option for multinomial family

# glmnet 1.7-4

* nasty bug fixed in fortran - removed reference to dble
* check class of `newx` and make `dgCmatrix` if sparse

# glmnet 1.7-1

* `lognet` added a classnames component to the object
* `predict.lognet(type="class")` now returns a character vector/matrix

# glmnet 1.6

* `predict.glmnet` : fixed bug with `type="nonzero"`
* `glmnet`: Now x can inherit from `sparseMatrix` rather than the very
   specific `dgCMatrix`, and this will trigger sparse mode for glmnet

# glmnet 1.5

* `glmnet.Rd` (`lambda.min`) : changed value to 0.01 if `nobs < nvars`,
  (`lambda`) added warnings to avoid single value,
  (`lambda.min`): renamed it `lambda.min.ratio`
* `glmnet` (`lambda.min`) : changed	value to 0.01 if `nobs < nvars`
    (`HessianExact`) : changed the sense (it was wrong),
   (`lambda.min`): renamed it `lambda.min.ratio`. This allows it to be
    called `lambda.min` in a call though 
* `predict.cv.glmnet` (new function) : makes predictions directly from
  the saved `glmnet` object on the cv object 
* `coef.cv.glmnet` (new function) : as above
* `predict.cv.glmnet.Rd` : help functions for the above
* `cv.glmnet` : insert `drop(y)` to avoid 1 column matrices; now include a `glmnet.fit` object for later predictions
* `nonzeroCoef` : added a special case for a single variable in `x`; it was dying on this
* `deviance.glmnet` : included
* `deviance.glmnet.Rd` : included

# glmnet 1.4 

* Note that this starts from version `glmnet_1.4`.
